# Twitter-Bot
The bot has two files. In both of them add your API credentials to run them.
quote.py quotes tweets of other twitter accounts with media and also likes their tweet and follows them. You'll need add phrases to the list so as to search for similar tweets.
random_tweet.py tweets random tweets from the list of tweets you gave them.
